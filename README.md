# What is Jekyll
Jekyll is a website generator that's designed for building minimal, static blogs or home pages

# Why to use Jekyll
* Simple : if you understand YAML/Markdown, it is enough for you. If you understand a bit about HTML/CSS, it will be better. But it is not mandatory.
* GitHub Host : it is super easy to host your website or blog on Github. No worry about web hosting. So convenient!
